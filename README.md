## Run `elm package install` before running `elm reactor` or `elm make` so that this app will actually be able to build. 
## To build the app, use `elm-make todo.elm`, otherwise you can use `elm reactor` to run the app on a dynamic server. 

### You can not dynamically build this application by copy and pasting the code into the [elm try online app](http://elm-lang.org/try).
